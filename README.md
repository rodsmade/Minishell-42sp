# Minishell-42sp

This is a minified Bash-like shell!

*GIF*

In this project, students are tasked with building a program that executes in a loop*, prompting the user for a command (or sequence of commands**), interpreting the inserted input and then executing the command, finally returning the prompt back to the user, until it is terminated by the user.

This minishell is able to run any commands that can be found in the `$PATH` variable or otherwise in a specified path; redirect input and outputs with redirection operators, as well as some built-in functionalities, and also supports the wildcard character `*`.

> *Commonly referred to as REPL - Read, Evaluate and Print Loop. Learn more about the REPL studying [this diagram](https://whimsical.com/minishell-architecture-big-picture-7b9N8PL3qHrddbs977mQ2J).

> **Also know as `pipelines`, that is, a sequence of terminal commands separated by the pipe character `|`.


## Features

- **Redirection operators** `>` (redirected output), `<` (redirected input), `>>` (append redirected output), and `<<` (heredoc);
- Basic built-ins for **navigation in the directory tree** (`pwd`, `cd`);
- Basic built-ins for **environment variables manipulation** (`env`, `export`, `unset`);
- Basic builtiins for **printing** on the terminal and **exiting** the shell (`echo`, `exit`);
- Parsing of **double quotes** and **single quotes** (`""` and `''`);
- Environment variable **expansion** (`$`);
- Execution of command via `$PATH`;
- Execution of command via **relative/absolute paths**;
- Execution of **pipelines** (sequential commands separated by `|`);
- :star: **Wildcards** (`*`);

## Final note
If you're a 42 student struggling to understand this project, I got your back! Please refer to this Notion page that I wrote covering the general concepts related to this project! It's in Portuguese :cactus:
